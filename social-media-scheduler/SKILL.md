## Core Capabilities

### 1. Content Scheduling
The primary function is to schedule social media posts. Manus can parse a content plan from a structured file (like a CSV or Markdown table) and schedule each post for a specific date and time.

- **Multi-Platform Support:** The skill is designed to be extensible to various platforms by leveraging their respective APIs or automation tools.
- **Flexible Timing:** Supports scheduling with precise date and time, including timezone considerations.
- **Bulk Scheduling:** Ability to ingest a content calendar and schedule dozens of posts in a single operation.

### 2. Automated Publishing
Once scheduled, Manus will execute the posts automatically at the designated times. This involves using the `Browser` or `Bash` (with tools like `curl`) to interact with social media platform APIs or web interfaces.

- **Text and Media:** Capable of publishing posts that include text, links, and media files (images, videos).
- **Error Handling:** Includes logic to handle potential posting failures (e.g., API errors, network issues) and retry or report the failure.

### 3. Performance Metrics Analysis
After publishing, the skill can be used to revisit the posts to collect performance data. This is crucial for understanding audience engagement and content effectiveness.

- **Data Collection:** Manus can scrape or query post URLs to gather metrics like likes, comments, shares, retweets, and click-through rates.
- **Data Aggregation:** The collected data is stored in a structured format (e.g., a CSV file) for analysis.
- **Report Generation:** Manus can process the aggregated data to create summary reports, identify trends, and highlight top-performing content.

### 4. Content Management
The skill includes helper functions for managing the content to be scheduled.

- **Content Calendar Template:** Provides a template for users to fill in their content plan.
- **Image and Video Handling:** Can reference local media files to be included in posts.
- **Link Shortening:** Can integrate with URL shortening services (like Bitly) via API to create trackable, clean links.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Create a Content Calendar
First, you need to define your content plan in a structured format. A CSV file is recommended for its simplicity and ease of parsing. Create a file named `content_calendar.csv`.

**`content_calendar.csv` Template:**
```csv
platform,publish_datetime_utc,post_text,media_path,link
"twitter","2026-03-15 14:00:00","Discover how AI is transforming healthcare. Our latest blog post dives deep into the future of medicine. #AI #Healthcare #Tech","","https://example.com/blog/ai-in-healthcare"
"linkedin","2026-03-15 16:30:00","Excited to share our new research on the impact of regenerative medicine. This article explores innovative treatments that are changing patients' lives. Read more here: [link] #RegenerativeMedicine #Innovation #MedTech","","https://example.com/research/regenerative-medicine"
"facebook","2026-03-16 10:00:00","Check out our new patient success story! See how minimally invasive techniques helped John get back on his feet faster. #PatientStory #Orthopedics #Success","./images/patient_story.jpg","https://example.com/stories/johns-journey"
"instagram","2026-03-17 18:00:00","A look inside our state-of-the-art clinic. We are committed to providing the best care with the latest technology. #Clinic #Healthcare #JoãoPessoa","./images/clinic_tour.mp4",""
```

### Step 2: Initiate the Scheduling Process
Instruct Manus to use the `social-media-scheduler` skill and provide the path to your `content_calendar.csv` file.

**User Prompt Example:**
> "Manus, please schedule the social media posts defined in `/home/ubuntu/project/content_calendar.csv`."

### Step 3: Manus Parses and Confirms the Schedule
Manus will read the CSV file, parse each row, and confirm the schedule with you before proceeding.

- **Action:** Use the `Read` tool to access `content_calendar.csv`.
- **Internal Logic:** Loop through each entry, validate the data (e.g., check if `publish_datetime_utc` is in the future), and store it in an internal schedule list.
- **Feedback:** Present a summary of the planned posts to the user for confirmation.

### Step 4: Automated Posting at Scheduled Times
This part of the workflow runs in the background. In a real-world scenario, this would involve setting up cron jobs or using a task scheduler. Within the Manus environment, it can be simulated by checking the current time against the schedule periodically.

- **Action:** At the scheduled time, Manus uses the `Browser` or `Bash` tool.
- **Example (Twitter using `curl` - conceptual):**
  ```bash
  # This is a conceptual example. Actual implementation requires OAuth 1.0a.
  # The user would need to have their Twitter developer credentials configured.
  ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
  ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="..."
  CONSUMER_KEY="..."
  CONSUMER_SECRET="..."

  STATUS="Discover how AI is transforming healthcare. Our latest blog post dives deep into the future of medicine. #AI #Healthcare #Tech https://example.com/blog/ai-in-healthcare"

  # The actual command would be much more complex, involving signing the request.
  curl --request POST --url 'https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets' --header "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data "{\"text\": \"$STATUS\"}"
  ```
- **Logging:** After attempting a post, Manus should log the result (success or failure) and the URL of the live post if successful. Create a `publication_log.csv`.

**`publication_log.csv` Template:**
```csv
original_platform,publish_datetime_utc,status,post_url,notes
"twitter","2026-03-15 14:00:00","success","https://twitter.com/user/status/123456789",""
"linkedin","2026-03-15 16:30:00","failure","","API connection error"
```

### Step 5: Performance Data Collection
After a set period (e.g., 24-48 hours), instruct Manus to collect engagement metrics for the published posts.

**User Prompt Example:**
> "Manus, please collect the performance metrics for the posts in `publication_log.csv` and save the results in `performance_data.csv`."

- **Action:** Manus reads `publication_log.csv`. For each successful post, it uses the `Browser` tool to navigate to the `post_url`.
- **Web Scraping (Conceptual):**
  - Navigate to the URL.
  - Use browser interaction tools to find elements containing like counts, comment counts, etc.
  - Extract the text or numerical value from these elements.
- **Data Storage:** Append the collected metrics to a new file, `performance_data.csv`.

**`performance_data.csv` Template:**
```csv
post_url,collection_datetime_utc,likes,comments,shares,clicks
"https://twitter.com/user/status/123456789","2026-03-16 14:05:00",152,23,45,312
```

### Step 6: Generate a Performance Report
Finally, ask Manus to analyze the collected data and generate a report.

**User Prompt Example:**
> "Manus, analyze `performance_data.csv` and generate a summary report highlighting the best-performing posts."

- **Action:** Read `performance_data.csv`.
- **Analysis:** Calculate total engagement, average engagement per post, and identify the post with the highest metrics.
- **Output:** Generate a Markdown file (`report.md`) with the analysis.

**`report.md` Template:**
```markdown
# Social Media Performance Report (Mar 15-17, 2026)

## Summary
- **Total Posts Analyzed:** 1
- **Total Likes:** 152
- **Total Comments:** 23
- **Total Shares:** 45

## Top Performing Post

**Post:** [https://twitter.com/user/status/123456789](https://twitter.com/user/status/123456789)

```

## Best Practices

- **Use a Staging or Test Account:** When first setting up or testing the skill, use a test account for social media platforms to avoid posting unintended content to a live profile.
- **Secure Credential Management:** API keys and access tokens should be handled securely. Use environment variables or a secure vault for storing credentials rather than hardcoding them in scripts or files.
- **Respect API Rate Limits:** Be mindful of the rate limits imposed by each social media platform's API. Implement delays between actions to avoid being blocked.
- **Vary Content:** Avoid posting the exact same message across all platforms. Tailor the `post_text` for each platform’s audience and format conventions.
- **Use High-Quality Media:** Ensure that any images or videos referenced in `media_path` are of high quality and optimized for web viewing.
- **Monitor Regularly:** While the skill automates posting, it's good practice to manually check the accounts periodically to ensure posts are appearing as expected and to engage with comments from your audience.
- **Incremental Data Collection:** Run the performance collection task regularly (e.g., daily) to build a historical dataset of your social media engagement. This will allow for more powerful trend analysis over time.

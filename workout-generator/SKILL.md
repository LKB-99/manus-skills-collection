# Workout Generator

## Overview
This skill is designed to assist users in creating personalized workout routines. It takes into account the user's fitness level, goals, available equipment, and preferences to generate a comprehensive and effective training program. The skill also incorporates principles of progressive overload and provides a framework for tracking progress over time, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation.

## When to Use This Skill
This skill is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

*   **Beginners:** For individuals who are new to fitness and need guidance on where to start.
*   **Intermediates:** For those who have some experience but want to create a more structured and progressive workout plan.
*   **Advanced Users:** For experienced lifters who want to optimize their training, break through plateaus, or try a new training split.
*   **Personal Trainers:** To quickly generate baseline workout plans for clients that can be further customized.
*   **Users with Limited Equipment:** To create effective workouts using only the equipment available to the user.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Personalized Workout Generation
The core of this skill is its ability to generate workout plans tailored to the individual. This is achieved by gathering information on the following parameters:

*   **Fitness Level:** Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced.
*   **Primary Goal:** Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy), Strength Gain, Fat Loss, or General Fitness.
*   **Training Frequency:** Number of days per week the user can train.
*   **Training Split:** The preferred way to split workouts (e.g., Full Body, Upper/Lower, Push/Pull/Legs).
*   **Available Equipment:** A list of equipment the user has access to (e.g., dumbbells, barbells, resistance bands, bodyweight).
*   **Exercise Preferences:** Any specific exercises the user enjoys or wants to include.
*   **Exercise Exclusions:** Any exercises the user wants to avoid due to injury or preference.

### 2. Progressive Overload Implementation
The skill incorporates the principle of progressive overload, which is crucial for long-term progress. It provides a clear progression path for each exercise in the workout plan. This can be achieved through various methods:

*   **Increasing Weight:** Gradually increasing the weight lifted for a given number of sets and reps.
*   **Increasing Reps:** Increasing the number of repetitions performed with the same weight.
*   **Increasing Sets:** Increasing the number of sets performed for an exercise.
*   **Decreasing Rest Time:** Reducing the rest periods between sets.
*   **Improving Form:** Focusing on better execution of the exercise.

### 3. Workout Tracking and Logging
To ensure progress is being made, the skill provides a template for tracking workouts. This allows users to log the following data for each session:

*   **Date:** The date of the workout.
*   **Workout:** The name of the workout performed (e.g., "Push Day A").
*   **Exercise:** The name of the exercise.
*   **Sets:** The number of sets performed.
*   **Reps:** The number of reps performed in each set.
*   **Weight:** The weight used for each set.
*   **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion):** A subjective measure of how difficult the set was on a scale of 1-10.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Gather User Information:** Start by asking the user for the necessary information to create their workout plan. Use a clear and concise set of questions.

2.  **Select a Training Split:** Based on the user's training frequency and preferences, choose an appropriate training split.

3.  **Choose Exercises:** Select exercises for each workout day based on the chosen split, available equipment, and user preferences. Ensure a balanced selection of compound and isolation exercises.

4.  **Set Volume (Sets and Reps):** Determine the number of sets and reps for each exercise based on the user's goal.

5.  **Define Progression:** Specify the progression model for each exercise.

6.  **Provide a Tracking Template:** Offer a template for the user to log their workouts.

## Best Practices

*   **Prioritize Compound Lifts:** Base the workout around compound exercises (e.g., squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, rows) as they provide the most bang for your buck.
*   **Include a Warm-up and Cool-down:** Always recommend a proper warm-up before each workout and a cool-down afterward.
*   **Listen to Your Body:** Advise users to pay attention to their bodies and not to push through pain.
*   **Be Consistent:** Emphasize the importance of consistency for achieving results.
*   **Focus on Form:** Remind users that proper form is more important than lifting heavy weight.
*   **Adjust as Needed:** Encourage users to adjust their workout plan as they progress and their goals change.

    .title { font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; }
    .subtitle { font-size: 25px; }
    .student-name { font-size: 40px; font-style: italic; margin: 40px 0; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="title">Certificate of Completion</div>
        <div class="subtitle">This certificate is proudly presented to</div>
        <div class="student-name">[STUDENT_NAME]</div>
        <div class="subtitle">for successfully completing the course</div>
        <div class="title">[COURSE_NAME]</div>
        <div class="subtitle">on [COMPLETION_DATE]</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Initialize the Course Project:**
    -   Start by creating a main directory for your course.
    -   Use the `Bash` tool to create a structured set of folders for modules, lessons, quizzes, and resources.

2.  **Define the Curriculum:**
    -   Create a `CURRICULUM.md` file.
    -   Outline the course structure, listing all modules and the lessons within each module.
    -   For each lesson, write a brief learning objective.

3.  **Generate Lesson Content:**
    -   For each lesson in your curriculum file, use the `Write` tool to create a new Markdown file (e.g., `module-1/lessons/lesson-1.md`).
    -   Provide the skill with the lesson title and learning objective to generate the content.
    -   Review and edit the generated content to ensure accuracy and clarity. Add your own insights and examples.

4.  **Create Quizzes:**
    -   After creating the content for a module, create a quiz file (e.g., `module-1/quizzes/quiz-1.md`).
    -   Use the skill to generate questions based on the content of the lessons in that module.
    -   Specify the number and type of questions you want (e.g., 5 multiple-choice, 2 true/false).
    -   Include an answer key in a separate section of the file.

5.  **Develop Supporting Resources:**
    -   Use the `Browser` tool to find relevant articles, images, and videos to supplement your course.
    -   Download or link to these resources in a `resources` folder for each module.
    -   Create cheat sheets, glossaries, or other supplementary documents.

6.  **Design the Certificate:**
    -   Create an HTML or Markdown template for the certificate of completion.
    -   Use placeholders like `[STUDENT_NAME]`, `[COURSE_NAME]`, and `[COMPLETION_DATE]` for personalization.

7.  **Package the Course:**
    -   Organize all files into a clean and logical structure.
    -   Create a `README.md` file in the root directory with instructions on how to navigate the course content.
    -   Compress the entire course directory into a ZIP file for easy distribution.

    ```bash
    # Example of zipping the course directory
    zip -r my-awesome-course.zip my-awesome-course
    ```

## Best Practices

-   **Start with the End in Mind:** Before you start creating content, have a clear understanding of who your audience is and what you want them to achieve by the end of the course.
-   **Be Iterative:** Don't try to perfect everything in one go. Create a first draft of your course, get feedback, and then iterate on it.
-   **Mix Content Types:** Keep learners engaged by using a variety of content formats, including text, images, videos, and interactive quizzes.
-   **Review and Refine:** Always review the AI-generated content for accuracy, tone, and style. Add your own voice and expertise to make the content unique.
-   **Keep Lessons Short and Focused:** Break down complex topics into smaller, digestible lessons. A good rule of thumb is to keep video lessons between 5-10 minutes long.
-   **Provide Clear Instructions:** Make sure that all instructions for assignments, quizzes, and activities are clear and easy to understand.
-   **Use a Consistent Structure:** Maintain a consistent file and folder structure throughout the course to make it easy for learners to navigate.

### Example 2: Generating a Certificate

1.  **Create Template:**
    -   Create a file named `certificate_template.html` with the HTML template provided in the 'Core Capabilities' section.

2.  **Personalize:**
    -   Use the `Edit` tool to replace the placeholders.
    ```python
    # Fictional tool usage for demonstration
    file.edit(
        path='certificate.html',
        edits=[
            {'find': '[STUDENT_NAME]', 'replace': 'Jane Doe'},
            {'find': '[COURSE_NAME]', 'replace': 'Python for Beginners'},
            {'find': '[COMPLETION_DATE]', 'replace': 'February 2, 2026'}
        ]
    )
    ```

3.  **Convert to PDF (using a hypothetical tool or external library):**
    ```bash
    # This might require installing a tool like 'wkhtmltopdf'
    wkhtmltopdf certificate.html jane_doe_certificate.pdf
    ```

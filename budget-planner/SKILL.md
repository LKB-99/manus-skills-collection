## Core Capabilities

This skill is equipped with a range of features designed to provide a holistic budgeting experience. These capabilities work together to help you create a detailed financial plan and monitor your progress over time.

### 1. Income and Expense Tracking

The foundation of any budget is a clear understanding of your income and expenses. This skill provides tools to track both, allowing you to see your complete financial picture.

*   **Expense Logging:** Record your daily expenses with detailed information, such as the date, amount, category, and a brief description.
*   **Recurring Transactions:** Set up recurring income and expenses (e.g., rent, subscriptions) to automate the tracking process.

### 2. Automated Spending Categorization

To simplify the process of analyzing your spending, the skill automatically categorizes your expenses based on predefined rules. This saves you time and ensures consistency in your budget.

*   **Custom Budgets:** Create a custom budget from scratch, setting spending limits for each category based on your income and financial goals.
*   **Budget vs. Actual Analysis:** Compare your actual spending to your budgeted amounts to identify areas where you are over or under budget.

Setting clear financial goals is essential for staying motivated and making progress. This skill helps you define and track your goals, whether you are saving for a short-term purchase or a long-term objective.

*   **Goal Creation:** Create specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) financial goals.
*   **Goal Tracking:** Monitor your progress towards each goal, with visualizations that show how much you have saved and how much you have left to go.
*   **Goal-Oriented Savings:** Allocate a portion of your income to your goals, ensuring that you are consistently working towards them.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

This workflow provides a structured approach to using the Budget Planner skill. Follow these steps to create and maintain your personal or family budget.

### Step 1: Initial Setup

1.  **Create a Budget File:** Start by creating a new Markdown file for your budget (e.g., `my-budget.md`). This file will serve as your central repository for all budget-related information.
2.  **Choose a Template:** Select a budget template that aligns with your financial goals. You can use one of the pre-built templates or create your own custom structure.

    *   **Template 1: 50/30/20 Rule**

        ```markdown
        # 50/30/20 Budget

        ## Income
        | Source | Amount |
        |---|---|
        | Salary | $3,000 |

        ## Expenses
        ### Needs (50%)
        | Category | Budgeted | Actual |
        |---|---|---|
        | Rent | $1,000 | |
        | Utilities | $200 | |

        ### Wants (30%)
        | Category | Budgeted | Actual |
        |---|---|---|
        | Dining Out | $300 | |
        | Entertainment | $150 | |

        ### Savings (20%)
        | Category | Budgeted | Actual |
        |---|---|---|
        | Emergency Fund | $300 | |
        | Investments | $300 | |
        ```

    *   **Template 2: Zero-Based Budget**

        ```markdown
        # Zero-Based Budget

        ## Income
        | Source | Amount |
        |---|---|
        | Salary | $3,000 |

        ## Expenses
        | Category | Budgeted | Actual | Remaining |
        |---|---|---|---|
        | Rent | $1,000 | | $0 |
        | Groceries | $400 | | $0 |
        | Savings | $500 | | $0 |
        ```

### Step 2: Track Your Income and Expenses

1.  **Log Your Income:** Record all sources of income in your budget file. Update this section whenever you receive money.
2.  **Record Your Expenses:** As you spend money, log each expense in the appropriate category. Be as detailed as possible to ensure accuracy.

### Step 3: Categorize Your Spending

1.  **Use Default Categories:** Start with the default categories provided by the skill. These cover most common spending areas.
2.  **Create Custom Categories:** If needed, create custom categories that reflect your unique spending habits. For example, you might create a 
category for "Pet Care" or "Hobbies."

### Step 4: Review and Adjust Your Budget

1.  **Weekly Review:** At the end of each week, review your spending and compare it to your budget. This will help you stay on track and make adjustments as needed.
2.  **Monthly Analysis:** At the end of each month, conduct a more in-depth analysis of your budget. Identify trends, celebrate successes, and find areas for improvement.
3.  **Adjust as Needed:** Your budget is not set in stone. Be prepared to adjust it as your income, expenses, or financial goals change.

## Best Practices

To get the most out of the Budget Planner skill, follow these best practices:

*   **Be Consistent:** The key to successful budgeting is consistency. Make it a habit to track your income and expenses regularly.
*   **Be Realistic:** When creating your budget, be realistic about your spending habits. If your budget is too restrictive, you are more likely to abandon it.
*   **Involve Your Partner:** If you share finances with a partner, involve them in the budgeting process. This will help ensure that you are both on the same page and working towards the same goals.
*   **Automate Your Savings:** Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account. This will help you save money without even thinking about it.
*   **Use a Digital Tool:** While you can use a pen and paper to create your budget, a digital tool like this skill can make the process much easier and more efficient.
*   **Review and Revise:** Your financial situation will change over time, so it's important to review and revise your budget regularly.

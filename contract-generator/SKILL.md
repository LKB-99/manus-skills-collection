## Core Capabilities

### 1. Template-Based Generation
The skill utilizes a robust library of legal templates as a foundation for contract creation. These templates are curated and validated to ensure they meet legal standards for various jurisdictions.

*   **Template Library:** Access a wide range of templates, including:
    *   Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
    *   Independent Contractor Agreement
    *   Service Agreement
    *   Residential Lease Agreement
    *   Website Terms and Conditions
    *   Privacy Policy
    *   Bill of Sale
    *   Promissory Note
*   **Customization:** Each template contains placeholders and variables that can be dynamically populated with user-provided information.

### 2. Dynamic Content Population
Users can provide specific details through prompts, which the skill then uses to fill in the blanks in the chosen template. This ensures that each contract is tailored to the specific needs of the user.

*   **Variable Injection:** The skill identifies variables such as `[Client Name]`, `[Service Description]`, `[Payment Amount]`, and `[Effective Date]` and replaces them with the correct information.
*   **Clause Selection:** Users can choose to include or exclude optional clauses based on their requirements. For example, a service agreement might have optional clauses for intellectual property rights or a non-compete agreement.

### 3. Output Formatting
The generated contract can be produced in various formats for ease of use and distribution.

*   **Markdown:** The default output format is a clean, readable Markdown file.
*   **PDF Conversion:** The skill can convert the final Markdown document into a professional-looking PDF file, ready for signing.
*   **Plain Text:** A simple text version can also be generated for easy copying and pasting into other applications.

### 4. Validation and Review
The skill includes a step for reviewing the generated contract before finalizing it. This allows the user to double-check all the details and make any necessary corrections.

*   **Preview Mode:** Before generating the final file, the skill can display a preview of the contract with all the populated data.
*   **Editing Loop:** If any changes are needed, the user can provide new information or corrections, and the skill will regenerate the contract.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Initiate the Skill:** Start by invoking the `contract-generator` skill.
2.  **Select a Template:** Manus will ask you to choose a contract template from the available library.
    *   **Example Prompt:** "Which type of contract would you like to generate? Available options are: NDA, Service Agreement, Lease Agreement..."
3.  **Provide Contract Details:** Manus will then prompt you for the necessary information to populate the template. This will be a series of questions.
    *   **Example Interaction (for a Service Agreement):**
        *   **Manus:** "What is the full name of the client?"
        *   **User:** "Innovate Corp."
        *   **Manus:** "Please provide a detailed description of the services to be rendered."
        *   **User:** "Development of a new e-commerce website with payment gateway integration."
        *   **Manus:** "What is the total payment amount?"
        *   **User:** "$10,000"
4.  **Review the Draft:** Once all the information is collected, Manus will generate a draft of the contract and present it for your review.
5.  **Request Edits (Optional):** If you spot any errors or want to make changes, you can instruct Manus to edit the document.
    *   **Example Prompt:** "Change the payment amount to $12,000 and add a clause for a 50% upfront payment."
6.  **Finalize and Export:** After you approve the draft, Manus will generate the final contract in your desired format (Markdown, PDF, or TXT).

## Best Practices

*   **Be Specific:** Provide clear and detailed information when prompted. Ambiguity can lead to a weak or unenforceable contract.
*   **Review Carefully:** Always read through the generated contract thoroughly before signing or sending it. Ensure all names, dates, and amounts are correct.
*   **Consult a Lawyer:** While this skill is a powerful tool, it is not a substitute for legal advice. For complex or high-stakes agreements, it is always best to have the contract reviewed by a qualified legal professional.
*   **Keep Records:** Save a copy of all generated contracts for your records. Digital signatures can be added using external tools.
*   **Jurisdiction:** Be mindful of the legal jurisdiction. The default templates are general, but some clauses may need to be adjusted to comply with local laws.

## Examples

### Example 1: Generating a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

**User:** "Manus, I need to create an NDA."

**Manus:** "Of course. I will use the standard Non-Disclosure Agreement template. Please provide the following information:
1.  Full name of the Disclosing Party.
2.  Full name of the Receiving Party.
3.  The effective date of the agreement.
4.  A description of the confidential information."

**User:**
1.  "My company, 'Innovate Forward Inc.'"
2.  "A potential partner, 'Synergy Solutions LLC.'"
3.  "Today's date."
4.  "Our proprietary algorithm for data analysis and related business strategies."

**(Manus generates the NDA and presents it for review)**

### Example 2: Creating a Freelance Service Agreement

**User:** "I need a service agreement for a freelance design project."

**Manus:** "Understood. I will use the Service Agreement template. Let's go through the details. What is the client's name? ..."

**(Manus proceeds to ask for all the necessary details, such as scope of work, payment terms, timeline, and ownership of intellectual property.)**

# Onboarding Guide

## Overview
The Onboarding Guide skill is designed to streamline the process of integrating new members into a team or organization. It helps create structured, comprehensive, and accessible onboarding documents that ensure a smooth and efficient ramp-up period. By leveraging this skill, you can automate the generation of personalized onboarding plans, track progress, and provide new hires with all the necessary information and resources in one centralized place. This skill is ideal for managers, HR professionals, and team leads who want to improve the onboarding experience and reduce the administrative overhead associated with it.

## When to Use This Skill
This skill is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **Hiring New Employees:** When a new full-time or part-time employee joins the company.
- **Onboarding Freelancers or Contractors:** To quickly bring external collaborators up to speed on projects, tools, and company culture.
- **Internal Team Transfers:** When an existing employee moves to a new team or department and needs to learn new processes and responsibilities.
- **Internship Programs:** To provide a structured learning path for interns over a fixed period.
- **Scaling Teams:** When a company is growing rapidly and needs a standardized and scalable onboarding process.
- **Remote and Hybrid Teams:** To ensure remote employees receive the same quality of onboarding as their in-office counterparts.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Onboarding Plan Generation
This capability allows you to generate a complete onboarding plan from a simple prompt or a predefined template. The plan can be customized based on the new member's role, team, and seniority level.

- **Role-Based Templates:** Generate plans tailored for specific roles like Software Engineer, Product Manager, Marketing Specialist, or Sales Representative.
- **30-60-90 Day Structure:** Automatically create a structured plan for the first three months, outlining key milestones, goals, and learning objectives.
- **Checklist Creation:** Generate detailed checklists for pre-boarding, first day, first week, and first month to ensure no critical step is missed.

### 2. Information and Resource Aggregation
Consolidate all essential information and resources into a single, easy-to-navigate guide. This prevents information overload and helps new hires find what they need quickly.

- **Company Information:** Include sections on company culture, values, mission, history, and organizational structure.
- **Tool and System Access:** Create a list of all necessary tools, software, and systems with instructions on how to get access.
- **Key Contacts:** Generate a list of important contacts, including the new hire's manager, mentor, HR business partner, and key team members.
- **Documentation Links:** Automatically find and embed links to important documents like the employee handbook, coding standards, project wikis, and process guides.

### 3. Task and Goal Management
Define and assign tasks and goals for the new team member to complete during their onboarding period. This helps them understand their responsibilities and what is expected of them.

- **Initial Project Assignment:** Outline the first project or set of tasks for the new hire to work on.
- **Learning Objectives:** Define specific learning goals, such as completing a training course, reading a book, or mastering a new tool.
- **Performance Goals:** Set clear performance expectations and KPIs for the first 30, 60, and 90 days.

### 4. Progress Tracking and Reporting
Monitor the new hire's progress throughout the onboarding process and generate reports for managers and HR.

- **Checklist Tracking:** Allow new hires and managers to check off completed items on the onboarding checklist.
- **Automated Reminders:** Send automated reminders for pending tasks and upcoming check-ins.
- **Feedback Collection:** Integrate forms or links to collect feedback from the new hire about their onboarding experience.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Initiate the Skill:** Start by invoking the `onboarding-guide` skill and specifying the new team member's role and name.
    
    *Example Command:*
    ```
    manus onboarding-guide --role "Software Engineer" --name "Jane Doe"
    ```

2.  **Select a Template:** Choose from a list of predefined templates or opt to create a custom guide.
    
    *Options:*
    - `[1] General Employee Onboarding`
    - `[2] Software Engineer Onboarding`
    - `[3] Sales Development Representative Onboarding`
    - `[4] Create Custom Onboarding Guide`

3.  **Customize the Content:** The skill will generate a draft of the onboarding guide in a Markdown file. Open the file and customize the content as needed. You can add, remove, or edit sections to fit your specific requirements.
    
    *Action:*
    ```bash
    # The skill will create a file like onboarding-jane-doe.md
    # Open this file in your favorite editor
    code onboarding-jane-doe.md
    ```

4.  **Fill in Role-Specific Details:** The template will contain placeholders like `[Manager Name]`, `[Mentor Name]`, `[Project Name]`, etc. Use the `Edit` tool or your editor to replace these placeholders with the correct information.

5.  **Generate Checklists:** Use the skill to generate detailed checklists for different phases of the onboarding.
    
    *Example Command (within the skill's context):*
    ```
    generate checklist --type pre-boarding
    generate checklist --type first-week
    ```

6.  **Aggregate Resources:** Instruct the skill to find and link to relevant internal documentation. It can search your company's wiki, Google Drive, or other document repositories.
    
    *Example Command:*
    ```
    find docs --query "coding standards for python"
    find docs --query "company holiday schedule 2026"
    ```

7.  **Share the Guide:** Once the guide is complete, share the Markdown file or a rendered version (e.g., PDF, web page) with the new team member.

## Best Practices

- **Start Before Day One:** A great onboarding experience begins before the new hire's first day. Use the `pre-boarding` checklist to ensure their accounts are created, hardware is shipped, and initial paperwork is completed.
- **Assign a Buddy/Mentor:** A dedicated buddy or mentor is invaluable. The onboarding guide should clearly identify who this person is and what their role is in the onboarding process.
- **Personalize the Experience:** While templates are a great starting point, always personalize the guide for the individual. Include a personal welcome message from the manager and team.
- **Make it Interactive:** Include small tasks and questions in the guide to keep the new hire engaged. For example, "Find the #random channel in Slack and introduce yourself with a fun fact."
- **Schedule Regular Check-ins:** The guide should include a schedule of check-in meetings with the manager, mentor, and HR. This ensures the new hire has regular opportunities to ask questions and provide feedback.
- **Keep it Updated:** An onboarding guide is a living document. Regularly review and update it to reflect changes in processes, tools, and team structure.

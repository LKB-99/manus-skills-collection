# Financial Dashboard

## Overview
This skill empowers Manus to create, manage, and analyze personal and business financial dashboards. It leverages data processing and visualization capabilities to provide interactive and insightful dashboards. By connecting to various data sources, this skill can generate a comprehensive overview of financial health, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and help in making data-driven decisions. Whether for personal budgeting or for complex corporate financial analysis, this skill provides the tools to build a customized and effective financial dashboard.

## When to Use This Skill
This skill is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

*   **Personal Finance Management:** When you need to track your income, expenses, savings, and investments to get a clear picture of your financial situation.
*   **Business Performance Tracking:** For business owners and managers who need to monitor financial KPIs, such as revenue, profitability, and cash flow, in real-time.
*   **Financial Reporting:** When you need to create automated and interactive financial reports for stakeholders, investors, or internal teams.
*   **Investment Portfolio Analysis:** For investors who want to monitor the performance of their investment portfolios and make informed decisions.
*   **Budgeting and Forecasting:** When you need to create budgets, set financial goals, and forecast future financial performance.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Data Integration and Processing
This skill can connect to various data sources to gather financial data, including:

*   **CSV and Excel Files:** Import financial data from spreadsheets.
*   **Databases:** Connect to SQL databases to retrieve financial records.
*   **APIs:** Integrate with financial APIs to get real-time data (e.g., stock prices, bank transactions).

The skill can process and clean the imported data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and structuring the data for analysis.

### 2. Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Tracking
The skill allows you to define and track a wide range of financial KPIs. These can be customized based on the specific needs of the user.

**Personal Finance KPIs:**
*   **Net Worth:** Total Assets - Total Liabilities
*   **Savings Rate:** (Income - Expenses) / Income
*   **Debt-to-Income Ratio:** Total Monthly Debt Payments / Gross Monthly Income
*   **Investment Portfolio Return:** The gain or loss on an investment portfolio over a specific period.

**Business Finance KPIs:**
*   **Gross Profit Margin:** (Net Sales – Cost of Goods Sold) / Net Sales
*   **Net Profit Margin:** Net Income / Revenue
*   **Operating Cash Flow:** Cash generated from normal business operations.
*   **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
*   **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** The cost of acquiring a new customer.
*   **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** The total revenue a business can expect from a single customer.

### 3. Interactive Visualizations
The skill can generate a variety of interactive charts and graphs to visualize financial data. This makes it easier to understand trends, patterns, and outliers.

**Supported Chart Types:**
*   **Line Charts:** For tracking trends over time (e.g., revenue growth, stock prices).
*   **Bar Charts:** For comparing financial metrics across different categories (e.g., expenses by category).
*   **Pie Charts:** For showing the composition of a whole (e.g., portfolio allocation).
*   **Tables:** For displaying detailed financial data in a structured format.
*   **Gauges and Scorecards:** For displaying single-value KPIs and their performance against a target.

### 4. Customizable Dashboards
The skill allows you to create fully customizable dashboards. You can choose which KPIs and visualizations to include, and arrange them in a way that makes sense for your needs. You can also set up alerts and notifications for specific financial events.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Initiate the Skill:** Start by invoking the `financial-dashboard` skill.
2.  **Define the Dashboard Scope:** Specify whether you want to create a personal or business financial dashboard.
3.  **Connect Data Sources:** Provide the necessary information to connect to your financial data sources (e.g., upload a CSV file, provide database credentials, or API keys).
4.  **Select KPIs:** Choose the KPIs you want to track from a predefined list or define your own custom KPIs.
5.  **Configure Visualizations:** Select the chart types and visualizations you want to include in your dashboard.
6.  **Generate the Dashboard:** Manus will process the data, calculate the KPIs, and generate the interactive dashboard.
7.  **Analyze and Interact:** Interact with the dashboard by filtering data, drilling down into details, and exploring different visualizations.
8.  **Export and Share:** Export the dashboard as a PDF or share a link to the interactive dashboard with others.

## Best Practices

*   **Start with Clear Goals:** Before creating a dashboard, define what you want to achieve with it. What questions do you want to answer? What decisions do you want to make?
*   **Focus on the Right Metrics:** Don't try to track everything. Focus on the KPIs that are most relevant to your goals.
*   **Keep it Simple and Clean:** A good dashboard should be easy to read and understand. Avoid clutter and unnecessary information.
*   **Use Visualizations Effectively:** Choose the right chart type for the data you are presenting. Use colors and labels to make your visualizations clear and informative.
*   **Provide Context:** Don't just show the numbers. Provide context and explanations to help users understand what the data means.
*   **Ensure Data Accuracy:** The insights from your dashboard are only as good as the data it is based on. Make sure your data is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
*   **Iterate and Improve:** A dashboard is not a one-time project. Continuously gather feedback from users and make improvements to your dashboard over time.

### Example Code Snippet (Python with Pandas and Matplotlib)

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load financial data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('financial_data.csv')

# Calculate total revenue
total_revenue = data['revenue'].sum()

# Calculate total expenses
total_expenses = data['expenses'].sum()

# Calculate net income
net_income = total_revenue - total_expenses

# Create a bar chart to visualize revenue and expenses
labels = ['Revenue', 'Expenses', 'Net Income']
values = [total_revenue, total_expenses, net_income]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(labels, values, color=['green', 'red', 'blue'])
plt.title('Financial Summary')
plt.ylabel('Amount (USD)')
plt.show()
```
